Cereals
are edible
seeds
that are used to create many different food products.
An
edible seed
[n 1]
is a
seed
that is suitable for
human
or
animal
consumption. Of the six major plant parts,
[n 2]
seeds are the dominant source of human
calories
and
protein
.
[1]
A wide variety of plant
species
provide edible seeds; most are
angiosperms
, while a few are
gymnosperms
. As a global food source, the most important edible seeds by weight are
cereals
, followed by
legumes
and then
nuts
.
[2]
Cereals and legumes correspond with the
botanical families
Poaceae
and
Fabaceae
, respectively, while nuts,
pseudocereals
, and other seeds form
polyphylic
groups based on their culinary roles.

Cereals
[
edit
]
A
cereal
, also called a
cereal grain
or simply a
grain
, is the edible seed of a
grass
, a
plant
in the
Poaceae
family. Cereals can be consumed in a variety of ways, all of which require
husking
and cooking, including
whole
, rolled,
puffed
, or
ground
into
flour
. Many cereals are present or past
staple foods
, providing a large fraction of the calories in the places in which they are eaten. Today, cereals provide almost half of all calories consumed in the world.

Some culinary fruits
This
list of culinary fruits
contains the names of some
fruits
that are considered
edible
in some
cuisines
. The word "fruit" is used in several different ways.
[1]
The definition of fruit for these lists is a culinary fruit, i.e. "Any sweet, edible part of a
plant
that resembles fruit, even if it does not develop from a floral ovary; also used in a technically imprecise sense for some sweet or sweetish
vegetables
, some of which may resemble a true fruit or are used in cookery as if they were a
fruit
, for example
rhubarb
."
[2]
[3]
Many edible plant parts that are
true fruits
botanically speaking, are not considered culinary fruits. They are classified as
vegetables
in the
culinary
sense (for example: the
tomato
,
zucchini
, and so on), and hence they do not appear in this list. Similarly, some botanical fruits are classified as nuts (e.g.
Brazil nut
and various
almonds
), or staples (e.g.
breadfruit
), and likewise do not appear here. There also exist many fruits which are edible and palatable but for various reasons have not become popular.

Culinary fruits by climate
[
edit
]
Temperate fruits
[
edit
]
Fruits
of
temperate
climates are almost always borne on
trees
or
woody
shrubs
or
lianas
. They will not grow adequately in the
tropics
, as they need a period of cold (a
chilling requirement
) each year before they will flower. The
apple
,
pear
,
cherry
, and
plum
are the most widely grown and eaten, owing to their adaptability. Many other fruits are important regionally but do not figure prominently in commerce. Many sorts of small fruit on this list are gathered from the wild, just as they were in
Neolithic
times.

cacti
yield edible fruits, which are important traditional foods for some
Native American
peoples:
Cardón
Dragonfruit
Prickly pear
Saguaro
Cereus peruvianus
Numerous other cactus species
Gymnosperms with fruit-like structures
[
edit
]
Only
Angiosperms
have fruit, a structure that surrounds the seed.
Gymnosperms
have naked seeds, but some of them have reproductive structures that resemble fruit.
[10]
Podocarps
[
edit
]
Podocarps are conifers in the family
Podocarpaceae
, The seed
cones
are highly modified and, in some, the seed is surrounded by fleshy scale tissue, resembling a drupe. These berry-like cone scales are eaten by birds which then disperse the seeds in their droppings and the cones can be eaten in many species. Podocarps are either half-hardy or frost tender, depending on species. Many genera are similar in that they have edible "fruits" and often don't have a common name.
Kahikatea
Manoao
Nageia
Podocarpus

South Asian cuisine
encompasses a delectable variety of
sub-cuisines
and cooking styles that vary very widely, reflecting the diversity of the
Indian subcontinent
, even though there is a certain centrality to the general ingredients used. Terms used the recipes of varied Indian and other South Asian sub-cuisines sometimes tend to be
multi-lingual and region-specific
, mostly based on the author's specific sub-ethnicity, the popularity of a given vegetable/spice in a given sub-cuisine within South Asia, etc.
Indian cuisine
is overwhelmingly vegetarian friendly and employs a variety of different
fruits
,
vegetables
,
grains
, and
spices
which vary in name from region to region within the country. Most Indian restaurants serve predominantly Punjabi/North Indian cuisine, while a limited few serve a very limited choice of some South Indian dishes like Dosa. But for the connoisseurs, India offers a complex and eclectic array of sub-cuisines to explore, which are equally vegetarian friendly and a delight to the taste buds.
Even for South Asian people, this wide variety of vegetables, fruits, grains and spices used in various Indian sub-cuisines can be mind-boggling because of the variety of region-specific names used for identifying the food items. Indian vegetable markets and grocery stores get their wholesale supplies from suppliers belonging to various regions/ethnicities from all over India and elsewhere, and the food suppliers/packagers mostly use sub-ethnic, region-specific item/ingredient names on the respective signs/labels used to identify specific vegetables, fruits, grains and spices based on their respective regions of origin. This further aggravates the confusion in identifying specific items/ingredients, especially for international consumers/expatriates looking to procure vegetables, fruits, grains and spices specific to Indian sub-cuisines.
This article attempts to centralize, compile and tabulate the various vegetables, fruits, grains and spices that are commonly employed in various South Asian sub-cuisines to help reduce this confusion in identifying and procuring various South Asian food ingredients, especially in the cross-regional, international markets/contexts.
The following is a list of common South Asian ingredients, as well as their names in the various local languages spoken.

Although
botany
distinguishes true
roots
(such as
taproots
and
tuberous roots
) from non-roots (such as
bulbs
,
corms
,
rhizomes
, and
tubers
, although some contain both
hypocotyl
and taproot tissue), the term "root vegetable" is applied to all these types in ordinary, agricultural, and culinary
usage
.
[1]
Root vegetables are generally
storage organs
, enlarged to store energy in the form of
carbohydrates
. They differ in the concentration and the balance among
starches
,
sugars
, and other types of
carbohydrate
. Of particular economic importance are those with a high carbohydrate concentration in the form of starch; starchy root vegetables are important
staple foods
, particularly in tropical regions, overshadowing
cereals
throughout much of
Central Africa
,
West Africa
,
[
citation needed
]
and
Oceania
, where they are used directly or mashed to make
fufu
or
poi
.
Many root vegetables keep well in
root cellars
, lasting several months. This is one way of
storing food
for use long after
harvest
, which is especially important in nontropical
latitudes
, where
winter
is traditionally a time of little to no harvesting. There are also
season extension
methods that can extend the harvest throughout the winter, mostly through the use of
polytunnels
.

This
list of sweet potato cultivars
provides some information about
varieties
and
cultivars
of
sweet potato
(
Ipomoea batatas
). Sweet potato was first domesticated in the
Americas
more than 5,000 years ago.
[1]
As of 2013, there are approximately 7,000 sweet potato cultivars. People grow sweet potato in many parts of the world, including New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, Hawaii, China, and North America. However, sweet potato is not widely cultivated in Europe.
[2]
People
breed
sweet potatoes mainly either for food (their nutritious
storage roots
) or for their attractive
flowering
vines
. (The variety 'Vardaman' is grown for both.) The first table below lists sweet potato cultivars grown for their edible roots; the second table lists cultivars bred as
ornamental vines
. In the first table, the Parentage column briefly explains how the sweet potato cultivar was bred. Sweet potato plants with desirable traits are
selectively bred
to produce new cultivars.
Sweet potato cultivars differ in many ways. One way people compare them is by the size, shape, and color of the roots. The more orange the
flesh
of a sweet potato root is, the more nutritious
carotene
it has. (Humans metabolize carotene into
vitamin A
.) The skin of a sweet potato root is a different color than the flesh. The biological word for the outer skin is
epidermis
; the flesh is called the
pith
or
medulla
. The first table below has a general description of the color of the root's flesh and skin.
In the mid-20th century, sweet potato growers in the
Southern United States
began marketing orange-fleshed sweet potatoes as "yams", in an attempt to differentiate them from pale-fleshed sweet potatoes.
[3]
Even though these growers called their products yams, true yams are significantly different. All sweet potatoes are variations of one species:
I. batatas
. Yams are any of various tropical species of the genus
Dioscorea
. A yam
tuber
is starchier, dryer, and often larger than the storage root of a sweet potato, and the skin is more coarse.
[3]
This list does not include yams.

Many of the sweet potato cultivars below were bred at
agricultural experiment stations
. An agricultural experiment station (AES) is a
research center
where scientists work to increase the quality and quantity of
food production
. Agricultural experiment stations are usually operated by a government agency and/or a university.

History
[
edit
]
Humans have used leaves as food since time immemorial. Different types of leaves, depending from the place and the season, were part of the
human diet
since prehistoric times. Traces of edible leaves have been found in ancient Egyptian archaeological sites. Some edible leaves were historically documented in ancient Greece, in ancient Rome, in ancient Sri Lanka and in the Middle Ages.
[1]
With the passing of the centuries many of those traditional leaf vegetables have been replaced by leaves that are more tender, have a more neutral taste or that are considered more refined. The leaves that were part of ancient traditional diets are still to be found in the wild, sometimes at the edge of cultivated fields, or near abandoned homesteads. Generally they are found not far from inhabited places, indicating that they are the vestiges of ancient cultivated plants.
[2]
There are places, like the Italian region of
Liguria
, where it is customary to go to the fields in spring to gather different kinds of edible leaves. These are later boiled to prepare
preboggion
, a local green mixture, that is generally used to stuff
ravioli
-like pasta. Also in Greece the tradition of eating a great variety of different leafy greens gathered in the fields has been preserved. These are eaten as a dish called
horta
.
Precautions
[
edit
]
Moderate quantities of edible
leaf vegetables
that are proportionate to amounts in local dishes, according to culture and place, are harmless unless there are allergies to chemicals in the leaves. For example, some people are allergic to
celery
leaves. At any rate, it is advisable not to eat large quantities of any particular leaf for protracted periods.
The fact that a certain leaf is part of the traditional cuisine of a country or an area is no guarantee that it is harmless as food. The leaves of the
black nightshade
(Solanum nigrum)
and similar species, contain
solanine
, an
alkaloid
. Despite their categorization among poisonous plants, nightshade species are part of the cuisine of certain countries, such as Ethiopia, India and Greece. The leaves are cooked in salty water, which is often boiled and drained more than once.
[3]
Emergency food
[
edit
]
Another category comprises edible leaves - from plants such as
alfalfa
,
Ruppia maritima
,
rice
or
wheat
, and cultivated
legumes
- that are used as emergency or famine food. They are eaten only during times of famine or in isolated areas when fishing or hunting fails.
[4]
Most such leaves are very rough fare as they are often used as fodder in times of plenty. During
Holodomor
, for instance, desperate Ukrainians ate leaves from bushes and trees when no other food was available.
[5]
Generally, the types of leaves that are eaten during emergency times only are not considered normally consumed leafy greens and have not been included in the list.

Black mustard is commonly found in neglected gardens, on roadsides, in abandoned fields, and in areas where waste is disposed of. The plant is native to Asia and Europe, but now grows over much of southern Canada and almost all of the United States. This is the chief mustard used in condiments and as such is normally associated with hot-dogs. To make the mustard condiment, the seeds must be ground fine and then mixed with flour and a small portion of water and vinegar. The plant can be cultivated for its young leaves which are used in a salad or as a pot herb.

Prickly lettuce is a common edible weed that is native to Europe, but can now be found from coast to coast in the United States. The name comes from the small prickles that can be found on the lower part of the stem and the midrib of the leaves. The plant is found in fields, places of waste, and roadsides. The leaves of the plant reach out towards the sun and for this reason the plant is sometimes called the Compass Plant. Prickly Lettuce can grow to be from two to five feet tall but should be harvested early on when it is a few inches high. The young leaves of the plant are very tender and make an excellent salad green. As a potherb, the plant needs little cooking and is commonly made with a sauce of melted butter or vinegar. Prickly lettuce should be harvested in spring or early summer.

This is a
list of cabbage dishes and foods
.
Cabbage
(
Brassica oleracea
or variants) is a leafy green or purple
biennial plant
, grown as an
annual
vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. Cabbage heads generally range from 0.5 to 4 kilograms (1 to 9 lb), and can be green, purple and white. Smooth-leafed firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed red and crinkle-leafed
savoy cabbages
of both colors seen more rarely. Cabbages are prepared in many different ways for eating. They can be
pickled
, fermented for dishes such as
sauerkraut
,
steamed
,
stewed
,
sautéed
,
braised
, or eaten raw. Cabbage is a good source of
vitamin K
,
vitamin C
and
dietary fiber
. Contaminated cabbage has been linked to cases of
food-borne illness
in humans.

Stir-fried
eggplant
This is a
list of eggplant dishes
. This list includes dishes in which the main ingredient or one of the essential ingredients is eggplant.
Eggplant
is used in the cuisine of many countries. It is often stewed, as in the French
ratatouille
, or deep fried as in the
Italian
parmigiana di melanzane
, the Turkish
karnıyarık
or Turkish and Greek
musakka/moussaka
, and
Middle-Eastern
and
South Asian
dishes. Eggplants can also be battered before deep-frying and served with a sauce made of
tahini
and tamarind. In Iranian cuisine, it is blended with whey as
kashk
e-bademjan
, tomatoes as
mirza ghasemi
or made into stew as
khoresh-e-bademjan
. It can be sliced and
deep-fried
, then served with plain
yogurt
, (optionally) topped with a tomato and
garlic sauce
, such as in the
Turkish dish
patlıcan kızartması
(meaning:
fried aubergines
) or without yogurt as in
patlıcan şakşuka
. Perhaps the best-known Turkish eggplant dishes are
imam bayıldı
(vegetarian) and
karnıyarık
(with minced meat).

A small bowl of mixed nuts
A typical assortment of mixed nuts
A
culinary nut
is a dry, edible
fruit
or
seed
that usually, but not always, has a high
fat
content. Nuts are used in a wide variety of edible roles, including in baking, as snacks (either roasted or raw), and as flavoring. In addition to
botanical nuts
, fruits and seeds that have a similar appearance and culinary role are considered to be culinary nuts.
[1]
Culinary nuts are divided into fruits or seeds in one of four categories:
True, or
botanical nuts
: dry, hard-shelled, uncompartmented fruit that do not split on maturity to release seeds;
[2]
[3]
Drupes
: fleshy fruit surrounding a stone, or pit, containing a seed (e.g.
almonds
);
[4]
Gymnosperm
seeds: naked seeds, with no enclosure (e.g.
pine nuts
);
Angiosperm
seeds: unenclosed seeds within a larger fruit (e.g.
peanuts
).
Nuts have a rich history as food. For many
indigenous peoples of the Americas
, a wide variety of nuts, including
acorns
,
American beech
, and others, served as a major source of
starch
and fat over thousands of years.
[5]
Similarly, a wide variety of nuts have served as food for
Indigenous Australians
for many centuries.
[6]
Other culinary nuts, though known from ancient times, have seen dramatic increases in use in modern times. The most striking such example is the peanut. Its usage was popularized by the work of
George Washington Carver
, who discovered and popularized many applications of the peanut after employing peanut plants for soil amelioration in fields used to grow cotton.

Cereals
are edible
seeds
that are used to create many different food products.
An
edible seed
[n 1]
is a
seed
that is suitable for
human
or
animal
consumption. Of the six major plant parts,
[n 2]
seeds are the dominant source of human
calories
and
protein
.
[1]
A wide variety of plant
species
provide edible seeds; most are
angiosperms
, while a few are
gymnosperms
. As a global food source, the most important edible seeds by weight are
cereals
, followed by
legumes
and then
nuts
.
[2]
Cereals and legumes correspond with the
botanical families
Poaceae
and
Fabaceae
, respectively, while nuts,
pseudocereals
, and other seeds form
polyphylic
groups based on their culinary roles.

Cereals
[
edit
]
A
cereal
, also called a
cereal grain
or simply a
grain
, is the edible seed of a
grass
, a
plant
in the
Poaceae
family. Cereals can be consumed in a variety of ways, all of which require
husking
and cooking, including
whole
, rolled,
puffed
, or
ground
into
flour
. Many cereals are present or past
staple foods
, providing a large fraction of the calories in the places in which they are eaten. Today, cereals provide almost half of all calories consumed in the world.

list of bread rolls
. A
bread roll

Pain d'épices
This is a
list of quick breads
.
Quick bread
is any
bread
leavened with some
leavening agents
other than
yeast
or
eggs
. Preparing a quick bread generally involves two mixing bowls. One contains all dry ingredients (including chemical leavening agents or agent) and one contains all wet ingredients (possibly including liquid ingredients that are slightly acidic in order to initiate the leavening process). In some variations, the dry ingredients are in a bowl and the wet ingredients are heated sauces in a saucepan off-heat and cooled.

Not to be confused with
sweetbreads
.
Various sweet breads at a "medieval day" event at
Velenje Castle
,
Velenje
,
Slovenia
This is a
list of sweet breads
. Sweet bread, also referred to as pan dulce, buns or coffee bread,
[1]
is a
bread
or cake that is typically sweet in flavor. Some sweet breads, such as Portuguese Pao Douce, may be prepared with
potato flour
, which imparts a sweet flavor and light texture to them.
[2]
Some sweet breads that originated as cake-breads, such as lardy cake, Bath buns and Chelsea buns, are classified as sweet breads in contemporary
culinary
taxonomy, even though some still have the word "cake" in them.

This is a
list of cheeses
by place of origin. Types of cheese are included;
brand names
are only included if they apply to a distinct variety of cheese.
Cheese
is a
milk
-based food that is produced in wide-ranging flavors, textures, and forms. Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been
pasteurized
, the
butterfat
content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging.
Herbs
,
spices
, or
wood smoke
may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as
Red Leicester
, is normally formed from adding
annatto
. While most current varieties of cheese may be traced to a particular locale, or culture, within a single country, some have a more diffuse origin, and cannot be considered to have originated in a particular place, but are associated with a whole region, such as
queso blanco
in
Latin America
.
Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate
recorded history
. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where
cheesemaking
originated, either in
Europe
,
Central Asia
or
the Middle East
, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to
Roman
times and, according to
Pliny the Elder
, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the
Roman Empire
came into existence.

Brick cheese
Wisconsin
Prepared in brick-shaped form, the color ranges from pale yellow to white, and it has a sweet and mild flavor when young, and matures into a strong ripe cheese with age. It is medium-soft, crumbles easily and is somewhat sticky to the knife.
Cheddar Cheese
Cheese curds
Best eaten within 24-48 hours of production and at room temperature. Fresh curds will often come in a bag and have a little whey in the bag. They are often high in moisture and salty and will likely squeak while you chew them.
After a couple days or after any refrigeration they can be "regenerated" with a couple seconds in a microwave, but they will not be the same or as fresh. They are good in an omelete or breaded and fried at this point. After a few days they will be like a young colby or cheddar.
Colby cheese
Kin to cheddar, but much milder. The curd is washed at production to rinse off the lactose (milk sugars). Bacteria do not have a chance to make the cheese more acidic as it ages, unlike cheddar. It melts well.

A package of
brick cheese
This is a
list of cheeses
typical of the United States. Types of cheese are included;
brand names
are only included if they apply to a distinct variety of cheese. Many additional European-type cheeses are also made in the United States, such as
Brie
,
Cheddar
,
Gouda
,
mozzarella
and
provolone
. Also, many local dairies throughout the country produce
artisan cheeses
and other more localized flavors. (The term "American cheese" is also sometimes misunderstood outside the United States to refer to
processed cheese products
.) Many American cheese varieties are related to European cheeses, with slightly different recipes, and with European-sounding names, such as
Swiss cheese
, which is not normally found or produced in Switzerland. Almost half of the cheese produced in the United States comes from Wisconsin and California.

Cubes of Bulgarian
sirene
white brined cheese
Brined cheese
, also sometimes referred to as
pickled cheese
for some varieties, is
cheese
that is matured in a solution of
brine
in an airtight or semi-permeable container. This process gives the cheese good stability, inhibiting bacterial growth even in warmer climates.
[1]
Brined cheeses may be soft or hard, varying in moisture content, and in colour and flavour, according to the type of milk used; though all will be rindless, and generally taste clean, salty and acidic when fresh, developing some piquancy when aged, and most will be white.
[1]
Washed-rind cheeses are periodically cured in a solution of
saltwater
brine and/or mold-bearing agents that may include beer, wine, brandy, and spices, making their surfaces amenable to a class of bacteria
Brevibacterium linens
(the reddish-orange "smear bacteria") that impart pungent odours and distinctive flavours, and produce a firm, flavourful rind around the cheese.

Map of major AOC cheeses-the size of the symbol equates to the size of production
This is a
list of cheeses
from
France
. Traditionally, there are from 350 to 450 distinct types of French cheese grouped into eight categories 'les huit familles de fromage'.
[1]
There can be many varieties within each type of cheese, leading some to claim closer to 1,000 different types of French cheese.
[1]
In 1962, French President
Charles de Gaulle
was famously quoted as saying
"Comment voulez-vous gouverner un pays qui a deux cent quarante-six variétés de fromage?"
("How can you govern a country which has two hundred and forty-six varieties of cheese?")

Protected designation of Origin
[
edit
]
Under the
Common Policy
of the
European Union
, certain established cheeses, including many French cheeses, are covered by a
protected designation of origin
(PDO), and other, less stringent, designations of geographical origin for traditional specialities, such as the French
appellation d'origine contrôlée
(AOC) system, the Italian
denominazione di origine controllata
(DOC) system, and the Spanish
Denominación de origen
system.
A complete list of agricultural products with an EU Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), or Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG), listed alphabetically by nation, is at the Europa Agriculture website.
[3]
French cheese production is classified under four categories, and PDO/AOC rules dictate which category(ies) each protected cheese may be assigned to:
[4]
Fermier
: farmhouse cheese, which is produced on the farm where the milk is produced.
Artisanal
: producer producing cheese in relatively small quantities using milk from their own farm, but may also purchase milk from local farms.
Coopérative
: dairy with local milk producers in an area that have joined to produce cheese. In larger
coopératives
quantities of cheese produced may be relatively large, akin to some
industriel
producers (many may be classed as factory-made
[5]
).
Industriel
: factory-made cheese from milk sourced locally or regionally, perhaps all over France (depending on the AOC/PDO regulations for specific cheeses).
56 cheeses are classified, protected, and regulated under French law. The majority are classified as
Appellation d'origine contrôlée
(AOC), the highest level of protection. Some are also protected under the less stringent but still legally regulated designation Label Régional (LR). A few French cheeses are protected under the European Union's Protected Geographic Indication designation (PGI). Many familiar generic types, like
Boursin
, are not covered. It may come as a surprise to see varieties of
Emmental cheese
protected as a
French
cheese. This list differs from those of
AOC
status.

This is a
list of egg dishes
.
Eggs
are laid by females of many different species, including
birds
,
reptiles
,
amphibians
, and
fish
, and have been eaten by mankind for thousands of years.
[1]
Bird and reptile
eggs
consist of albumen (
egg white
) and vitellus (
egg yolk
), contained within various thin membranes all surrounded by a protective
eggshell
. Popular choices for egg consumption are
chicken
,
duck
,
quail
,
roe
, and
caviar
, but the egg most often consumed by humans is the
chicken egg
, by a wide margin.

Flavor
Origin
Description
Boiled egg
Plain
This dish includes boiling long enough to be ("hard boiled") or just long enough for the albumen (egg white) to solidify ("soft boiled").
Coddled egg
[2]
Plain
In
cooking
, coddled eggs are gently or lightly cooked eggs. They can be partially cooked, heavily cooked, or hardly cooked at all.
Cheese Omelette Sandwiches
India
Egg omelette stuffed in bread and served with lots of cheese on it.
Fried egg
Plain
Cooked in hot grease in a
skillet
: cooked lightly on one side only ("sunny side up"), cooked lightly on one side and turned over briefly ("over easy"), cooked on both sides so the white is solid but the
yolk
still soft and runny ("over medium")
[3]
and thoroughly cooked on both sides with the yolk solid ("over well"), and with the yolk broken ("over hard").
Omelette
Plain
France
A
dish
made from beaten eggs quickly cooked with
butter
or
oil
, but not further stirred while cooking, in a
frying pan
, sometimes folded around a filling such as
cheese
,
vegetables
,
meat
(often
ham
), or some combination of the above.
Sometimes an Omelette will be placed under a grill to cook the top as it may not be possible to flip and the bottom may burn before the top is cooked through.
Flat Egg
Plain
UK
Similar to an
omelette
, with a single beaten egg, but salt/pepper is added to the egg prior to cooking, and cooked in a dry pan, or with minimal oil. When one side is complete it is flipped to the other side. The egg is usually cooked until brown on both sides and then served on bread.
A flat egg is always served on bread as a sandwich style and never served on a plate with other items, as an Omelette can be.
'Flat Egg' is a colloquial term, and differs from an omelette as it never contains any other items, and is used where a person doesn't like the white or yolk of an egg, so when beaten they can enjoy a cooked egg.

egg whites
and
yolks

Basted egg
Plain
Sunny-side-up eggs that are slightly cooked on the top. This can be accomplished by spooning fat from the pan onto the eggs
[5]
or by turning them and cooking the yolk side for a few seconds.
[6]

This
list of egg topics
connects to numerous articles about
eggs
. The wide-ranging diversity of topics here exceeds the scope of any other single article to link all of these articles.
This list of egg topics is not intended to be complete, but it spans the vast majority of related articles. The names of articles were linked from current articles, but those article names might be changed, at a later time.
Also, names might not be the commonly accepted English-language terms for a particular topic. However, with food dishes, non-English names are often adopted into the culture, such as with "
Huevos rancheros
" as an egg dish found in
Tex-Mex cuisine
.

cattle
. Beef can be harvested from cows, bulls, heifers or steers. Acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.

pork
and
poultry
at 38% and 30% respectively.

Veal
is the meat of young cattle (

dairy cattle
breeds.

Roasting or
grilled chicken
, one of the most common methods to cook and prepare
chicken
worldwide.
This is a
list of chicken dishes
.
Chicken
is the most common type of
poultry
in the world,
[1]
and was one of the first domesticated animals. Chicken is a major worldwide source of
meat
and
eggs
for human consumption. It is prepared as
food
in a wide variety of ways, varying by region and culture. The prevalence of chickens is due to almost the entire chicken being edible, and the ease of raising them.
Chicken as a meat has been depicted in
Babylonian
carvings from around 600 BC.
[2]
Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the
Middle Ages
.
[

It was eaten over most of the
Eastern hemisphere
and a number of different kinds of chicken such as
capons
,
pullets
and hens were eaten. It was one of the basic ingredients in the so-called
white dish
, a
stew
usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in
milk
and seasoned with spices and
sugar
.

[30]
[31]
Other versions claim the term "slider" originated from the hamburgers served by flight line galleys at military airfields, which were so greasy they slid right through you; or because their small size allows them to "slide" right down your throat in one or two bites.

Slugburger
Northeast
Mississippi
Traditional southern delicacy found in northeast
Mississippi
, particularly
Corinth

meat. Additional meats are also used.
Steamed cheeseburger
Mainly available in central
Connecticut
. It is believed to have been invented at a restaurant called "Jack's Lunch" in
Middletown
, Connecticut in the 1930s.
Instead of being fried in a pan or grilled on a grill, a
steamed
cheeseburger is steamed in a stainless-steel cabinet containing trays that hold either a hamburger patty or a piece of cheese. This method of cooking makes the fats in the meat melt away, resulting in a moist, juicy burger which is then put on a bun and covered with the melted cheese. Various customary toppings can then be added to the burger.
[34]

wet curing

, "ham" may refer to a product which has been through mechanical re-forming. The precise nature of meat termed "ham" is controlled in a number of areas, often by statute, including the United States and European Union. In addition, numerous ham products have specific
geographical indication
protection, such as
Prosciutto di Parma
and Prosciutto Toscano PDO in Europe, and

or 羊肉串
Yangrouchuan
— The most popular Xinjiang dish in China: chunks of mutton or mutton fat pierced on metal (or wood or bamboo) skewers, grilled on a coal-fired barbecue, and served with
cumin
and
chili
paste. Across Xinjiang, and neighbouring regions such as Kyrgyzstan, the mutton fat is valued equivalent to or more than the meat itself, as it provides energy during the harsh winter months. It has also become a popular street food all over north and west China, where a wide variety of foods are cooked in such a manner. Chuanr was traditionally made from lamb (yáng ròu chuàn, 羊肉串), which is still the most common, but now, chicken, pork, beef, and seafood are used. It is typically roasted over charcoal or electric heat, but it is sometimes cooked by deep frying in oil (popular in Beijing).

Roasted baby back
pork ribs
This is a
list of pork dishes
.
Pork
is the
culinary name
for
meat
from the
domestic pig
(
Sus domesticus
). It is one of the most commonly consumed meats worldwide,
[1]
with evidence of pig
husbandry
dating back to
5000 BC
. Pork is eaten both freshly cooked and preserved.
The consumption of pork is prohibited in
Judaism
,
Islam
, and some Christian denominations such as
Seventh-day Adventism
.
Fresh pork may contain
trichinosis
, a
parasitic disease
caused by eating raw or undercooked
pork
or
wild game
infected with the
larvae
of a species of
roundworm
Trichinella spiralis
, commonly called the
trichina worm
. In the
United States
, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture
recommends cooking ground pork to an internal temperature of 160 °F, followed by a 3-minute rest, and cooking whole cuts to a minimum internal temperature of 145 °F, also followed by a 3-minute rest.

List of bacon dishes
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The following is a
list of bacon dishes
. The word
bacon
is derived from the
Old High German
bacho
, meaning "buttock", "ham", or "side of bacon", and cognate with the
Old French
bacon
.
[1]
Bacon
is made from the sides, belly, or back of the
pig
and contains varying amounts of fat depending on the cut.
[2]
It is cured and
smoked
over wood cut from
apple trees
,
mesquite trees
, or
hickory trees
.
[3]
Bacon is used as an ingredient or
condiment
in a number of dishes.

Cereals
are edible
seeds
that are used to create many different food products.
An
edible seed
[n 1]
is a
seed
that is suitable for
human
or
animal
consumption. Of the six major plant parts,
[n 2]
seeds are the dominant source of human
calories
and
protein
.
[1]
A wide variety of plant
species
provide edible seeds; most are
angiosperms
, while a few are
gymnosperms
. As a global food source, the most important edible seeds by weight are
cereals
, followed by
legumes
and then
nuts
.
[2]
Cereals and legumes correspond with the
botanical families
Poaceae
and
Fabaceae
, respectively, while nuts,
pseudocereals
, and other seeds form
polyphylic
groups based on their culinary roles.

Cereals
[
edit
]
A
cereal
, also called a
cereal grain
or simply a
grain
, is the edible seed of a
grass
, a
plant
in the
Poaceae
family. Cereals can be consumed in a variety of ways, all of which require
husking
and cooking, including
whole
, rolled,
puffed
, or
ground
into
flour
. Many cereals are present or past
staple foods
, providing a large fraction of the calories in the places in which they are eaten. Today, cereals provide almost half of all calories consumed in the world.

Starting on a local doughnut`s dough, rolled, shape molded, deep fried, sliced, opened two halves, filled, recap and topped.

United Kingdom – Similar to North American doughnuts, but traditionally topped with granulated sugar rather than powdered sugar or glaze. Jam doughnuts are ball-shaped, coated in granulated sugar, and have a filling of strawberry or raspberry jam (alternatively, of caramel or vanilla custard). In some parts of Scotland, ring doughnuts are referred to as
doughrings
, with the term doughnut being reserved exclusively for the nut–shaped variety. Glazed, twisted rope–shaped doughnuts are known as
yum–yums
. It is also possible to buy
fudge doughnuts
in certain regions of Scotland. In some parts of Northern Ireland, ring doughnuts are referred to as
gravy rings
due to their being cooked in oil, itself colloquially known as "gravy".

Twisted doughnuts
are strands of dough that are braided and fried. The “Persian” is also considered a doughnut in some parts of the United States.
[3]
While not a doughnut, per se, it is a bread-like cinnamon roll, traditionally baked, but later French fried. Bennett's Bakery reportedly invented the original in the 1930s in Thunder Bay.
[4]
But they are not considered a doughnut there, but rather a sweetbread. In America, cinnamon rolls were French fried. The “Persian doughnut” comes with various toppings and frostings, often chocolate. In some locations it is commonly called a chocolate-covered “fried roll.”

Some different colours and shapes of pasta in a pasta specialty store in Venice
There are many different varieties of
pasta
, a staple dish of
Italian cuisine
.
Some pasta varieties are uniquely regional and not widely known; some types or forms may have different names in different languages, or sometimes in the same language. For example, the cut
rotelle
is also called
ruote
in Italy and
wagon wheels
in the United States. Manufacturers and cooks often invent new shapes of pasta; or may invent new names for preexisting shapes for marketing reasons.
Italian
pasta names often end with the
masculine
plural
suffixes
-ini
,
-elli
,
-illi
,
-etti
or the feminine plurals
-ine
,
-elle
etc., all conveying the sense of "little"; or with
-oni
,
-one
, meaning "large". Many other suffixes like
-otti
("largish") and
-acci
("rough", "badly made") may occur, too. In Italian, all pasta type names are plural.

Canned cod liver
Cod is popular as a
food
with a mild flavour and a dense, flaky
white flesh
. Young Atlantic cod or
haddock
prepared in strips for cooking is called
scrod
. Cod's soft liver can be canned or fermented into
cod liver oil
, providing an excellent source of
vitamin A
,
vitamin D
,
vitamin E
and
omega-3 fatty acids
(
EPA
and
DHA
).
[

Cod flesh is moist and flaky when cooked and is white in colour. In the United Kingdom
Atlantic cod
is one of the most common ingredients in
fish and chips
, along with
haddock
and
plaice
. Cod can be easily turned into various other products, as cod liver oil, omega pills, etc.

Haddock
is a very popular food fish, sold fresh,
smoked
, frozen, dried, and, to a small extent, canned. Haddock, along with
cod
and
plaice
, is one of the most popular fish used in British
fish and chips
.
Fresh haddock has a clean white flesh and can be cooked in the same ways as cod. Freshness of a haddock fillet can be determined by how well it holds together, as a fresh one will be firm; also, fillets should be translucent, while older fillets turn a chalky hue. Young, fresh haddock and cod fillets are often sold as
scrod
in
Boston, Massachusetts
; this refers to the size of the fish which have a variety of sizes, i.e. scrod, markets, and cows. Haddock is the predominant fish of choice in Scotland in a
fish supper
. It is also the main ingredient of Norwegian fishballs (fiskeboller).
Unlike the related
cod
, haddock does not
salt
well and is often preserved by
drying
and
smoking
.
The smoking of haddock is something that was highly refined in
Grimsby
.
Traditional Grimsby smoked fish
(mainly haddock, but sometimes cod) is produced in the traditional smoke houses in Grimsby, which are mostly family-run businesses that have developed their skills over many generations.
[1]
Grimsby fish market sources its haddock from the North East Atlantic, principally Iceland, Norway and Faroe. These fishing grounds are sustainably managed
[2]
and have not seen the large scale depreciation in fish stocks seen in EU waters.
[3]
One popular form of haddock is
Finnan Haddie
, named for the fishing village of
Finnan or Findon
in Scotland, where it was originally cold-smoked over
peat
. Finnan haddie is often served
poached
in milk for
breakfast
.
[4]
The town of
Arbroath
on the east coast of Scotland produces the
Arbroath Smokie
. This is a hot-smoked haddock which requires no further cooking before eating.
Smoked haddock naturally has an off-white color; it is very often
dyed
yellow, as are other smoked fish. Smoked haddock is the essential ingredient in the Anglo-Indian dish
kedgeree
.
In 2010, Greenpeace International has added the haddock to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."
[5]
Pollock
[
edit
]
Further information:
Alaska pollock as food
Atlantic pollock
is largely considered to be a whitefish, although it is a fairly strongly flavored one. Traditionally a popular source of food in some countries, such as
Norway
, in the United Kingdom it has previously been largely consumed as a cheaper and versatile alternative to cod and haddock. However, in recent years pollock has become more popular due to over-fishing of cod and haddock. It can now be found in most supermarkets as fresh fillets or prepared freezer items. For example, it is used minced in
fish fingers
or as an ingredient in
imitation crab meat
.
Because of its slightly gray color, pollock is often prepared, as in Norway, as fried fish balls, or if juvenile sized, breaded with
oatmeal
and fried, as in
Shetland
. Year-old fish are traditionally split, salted and dried over a peat hearth in
Orkney
, where their texture becomes wooden and somewhat phosphorescent. The fish can also be salted and smoked and achieve a
salmon
-like orange color (although it is not closely related to the salmon), as is the case in
Germany
where the fish is commonly sold as
Seelachs
or sea salmon. In Korea, pollock may be repeatedly frozen and melted to create
hwangtae
, half-dried to create
ko-da-ri
, or fully dried and eaten as
book-o
.
In 2009, U.K. supermarket
Sainsbury's
renamed pollock 'Colin' in a bid to boost ecofriendly sales of the fish as an alternative to cod.
[6]
The supermarket also suggested some shoppers may be too embarrassed to ask for the species under its proper title, due to its reputation as an inferior fish, and its similarity to a popular English swear word (
bollocks
). Sainsbury's, which said the new name was derived from the French for cooked pollock (
colin
), launched the product under the banner "Colin and chips can save British cod."

[7]
Crappit heid
Scotland
(English: stuffed head).
Can be traced to the fishing communities of the North, Hebrides and North-Eastern Scotland in the eighteenth century. In a time when money was scarce, the more expensive
fillets
of fish, such as
cod
or
haddock
would be sold to market but the
offal
and less attractive parts were retained by the fisherfolk for the pot.
Cullen skink
Scotland
Thick soup made of smoked haddock, potatoes and onions. An authentic cullen skink will use
finnan haddie
, but it may be prepared with any other undyed smoked haddock. The soup is often served as a starter at formal Scottish dinners. It has been described as "smokier and more assertive than American
chowder
and heartier than classical French
bisque
".
[8]
Fish and brewis
Newfoundland
Consists of cod and
hard bread
or
hard tack
. With the abundance of cod around the coasts of
Newfoundland and Labrador
it became synonymous with many Newfoundland households as a delicacy to be served as a main meal.
salt fish
is soaked in water overnight to reduce the salt content. The hard bread is broken into bite-size pieces, and is also soaked in water overnight. The next day, the fish and hard bread are boiled separately until tender, and then both are served together. The traditional meal is served with
scrunchions
,
[9]
salted pork fat which has been cut into small pieces and fried. Both the rendered fat and the liquid fat are then drizzled over the fish and hard bread.
Fish ball
Widespread
Usually made from a white fish, such as
cod
or
haddock
Fishcake
British
Similar to a
croquette
, consisting of a
filleted fish
and potato patty sometimes coated in
breadcrumbs
or
batter
, and fried. Salted cod is traditionally used as a filling, though since cod stocks have become depleted other varieties of
white fish
are used, such as
haddock
or
whiting
.
[10]
The fishcake has been seen as a way of using up
leftovers
that might otherwise be thrown away. In
Mrs Beeton
's 19th century publication
Book of Household Management
, her recipe for fishcakes calls for "leftover fish" and "cold
potatoes
".

Herrings
are
forage fish
, mostly belonging to the family
Clupeidae
. They often move in large
schools
around
fishing banks
and near the coast. The most abundant and commercially important species belong to the genus
Clupea
, found particularly in shallow, temperate waters of the North
Pacific
and the North
Atlantic
oceans, including the
Baltic Sea
, as well as off the west coast of South America. Three species of
Clupea
are recognized. The main taxa, the
Atlantic herring
, accounts for over half the world's commercial capture of herrings.
Herrings played a pivotal role in the history of marine fisheries in Europe,
[1]
and early in the twentieth century their study was fundamental to evolution of
fisheries science
.
[2]
[3]
These
oily fish
[4]
also have a long history as an important
food fish
, and are often
salted
,
smoked
, or
pickled
.

USDA Nutrient Database
Herring are very high in the long-chain
Omega-3 fatty acids
EPA
and
DHA
.
[5]
They are a source of
vitamin D
.
Water pollution
influences the amount of herring that may be safely consumed. For example, large Baltic herring slightly exceeds recommended limits with respect to
PCB
and
dioxin
, although some sources point out that cancer-reducing effect of omega-3 fatty acids is statistically stronger than the cancer-causing effect of PCBs and dioxins.
[6]
The contaminant levels depend on the age of the fish which can be inferred from their size. Baltic herrings larger than 17 cm may be eaten twice a month, while herrings smaller than 17 cm can be eaten freely.
[7]
Mercury in fish
also influences the amount of fish that women who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant within the next one or two years may safely eat.
Preparation
[
edit
]
Herring has been a
staple food
source since at least 3000 B.C. There are numerous ways the fish is served and many regional recipes: eaten raw, fermented,
pickled
, or cured by other techniques.
Raw
[
edit
]
A typical Dutch delicacy is
Hollandse Nieuwe
(Dutch New), which is raw herring from the catches around the end of spring and the beginning of summer. This is typically eaten with raw onion. Hollandse nieuwe is only available in spring when the first seasonal catch of herring is brought in. This is celebrated in festivals such as the
Vlaardingen
Herring Festival and Vlaggetjesdag in
Scheveningen
. The new herring are frozen and enzyme-preserved for the remainder of the year. The herring is said to be eaten "raw" because it has not been cooked, although it has been subjected to a degree of curing. The first barrel of Hollandse Nieuwe is traditionally sold at auction for charity. Very young herring are called
whitebait
and are eaten whole as a delicacy.
Fermented
[
edit
]
In Sweden, Baltic herring ("Strömming") is fermented to make
surströmming
.
Pickled
[
edit
]
Pickled herrings
are part of Scandinavian, Nordic, Dutch, German (
Bismarckhering
), Polish, Baltic, Eastern Slavic and Jewish
[8]
cuisine. Most cured herrings uses a two-step process. Initially, the herrings are cured with salt to extract water. The second stage involves removing the salt and adding flavorings, typically a vinegar, salt, sugar solution to which ingredients like peppercorn, bay leaves and raw onions are added. Other flavors can be added, such as sherry, mustard and dill. The tradition is strong in Scandinavia, The Netherlands, Iceland and Germany.
Dried
[
edit
]
In the Philippines, dried herring is popularly eaten during breakfast, along with garlic rice and eggs.
Smoked
[
edit
]
A
kipper
is a split, gutted and cold smoked herring, a
bloater
is a whole gutted and cold smoked herring and a
buckling
is a whole herring, gutted apart from
roe
or
milt
and then hot smoked herring. All are staples of
British cuisine
. According to
George Orwell
in
The Road to Wigan Pier
, the Emperor
Charles V
erected a statue to the inventor of bloaters.
Smoked herring is a traditional meal on the Danish island in the Baltic Sea, Bornholm. This is also the case in Sweden where one can get hard fried/smoked "Strömming" named "Sotare" in places like
Skansen
, Stockholm.
Other
[
edit
]
In Scotland, herrings are traditionally filleted, coated in seasoned
pin-head oatmeal
, and fried in a pan with butter or oil. This dish is usually served with "crushed", buttered, and boiled potatoes.
In Sweden,
herring soup
is a traditional dish.
In
Southeast
Alaska
,
western hemlock
boughs are cut and placed in the ocean before the herring arrive to spawn. The
fertilized
herring eggs stick to the boughs, and are easily collected. After being boiled briefly the eggs are removed from the bough. Herring eggs collected in this way are eaten plain or in herring egg
salad
. This method of collection is part of
Tlingit
tradition.

Description
Avruga caviar
Spain
Avruga is marketed by the Spanish company Pescaviar as a
caviar substitute
. It is made from herring (40%), salt, corn starch, lemon juice,
citric acid
,
xanthan gum
,
sodium benzoate
,
squid ink
and water. Unlike caviar, it does not contain
fish roe

[9]
Bloater
England
Popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries, bloaters are now rare. They can be contrasted with
kippers
. Kippers are salted and cold smoked overnight while bloaters are salted less and not smoked for so long. Kippers are split and gutted before smoking while bloaters are smoked whole without gutting. Kippers are associated with Scotland while bloaters are associated with England. Bloaters have their own characteristic slightly gamey flavor and are called "bloaters" because they swell or bloat during preparation.

mustard
seeds, and a little
sugar
. The herring are served cold with bread and fried or jacket potatoes].
[15]
Buckling
European
A hot-smoked
herring
similar to a
kipper
or
bloater

Raw herring dish
This article is about raw fish or shellfish. It includes
marinated
raw fish (soaked in a seasoned liquid) and raw fish which is lightly
cured
such as
gravlax
, but not fish which is fully cured (fermented,
pickled
, smoked or otherwise preserved).

Differential symptoms of parasite infections by raw fish. All have gastrointestinal, but otherwise distinct, symptoms.

Fish diseases and parasites
Parasites
in fish are a natural occurrence and common. Though not a health concern in thoroughly cooked fish, parasites are a concern when consumers eat raw or lightly preserved fish such as
sashimi
,
sushi
,
ceviche
, and
gravlax
. The popularity of such
raw fish dishes
makes it important for consumers to be aware of this risk. Raw fish should be frozen to an internal temperature of −20 °C (−4 °F) for at least 7 days to kill parasites. It is important to be aware that home freezers may not be cold enough to kill parasites.
[5]
[6]
Traditionally, fish that live all or part of their lives in
fresh water
were considered unsuitable for sashimi due to the possibility of parasites (see
sashimi
article). Parasitic infections from freshwater fish are a serious problem in some parts of the world, particularly
Southeast Asia
[
citation needed
]
. Fish that spend part of their life cycle in
brackish
or freshwater, like salmon are a particular problem. A study in
Seattle, Washington
showed that 100% of wild salmon had roundworm larvae capable of infecting people. In the same study farm raised salmon did not have any roundworm larvae.
[7]
Parasite
infection by raw fish is rare in the developed world (fewer than 40 cases per year in the U.S.
[
citation needed
]
), and involves mainly three kinds of parasites:
Clonorchis sinensis
(a trematode/fluke),
Anisakis
(a nematode/roundworm) and
Diphyllobothrium
(a cestode/tapeworm). Infection risk of anisakis is particularly higher in fishes which may live in a river such as salmon (
sake
) in
Salmonidae
or mackerel (
saba
). Such parasite infections can generally be avoided by boiling, burning, preserving in salt or vinegar, or freezing overnight. In Japan it is common to eat raw salmon and ikura, but these foods are frozen overnight prior to eating to prevent infections from parasites, particularly anisakis.

Nordic
Raw
salmon
, lightly cured in salt, sugar, and
dill
. Usually served as an
appetizer
, sliced thinly and accompanied by a dill and mustard sauce with bread or boiled potatoes. Made by fishermen in the
Middle Ages
, who salted salmon and lightly fermented it by burying it in the sand above the high-tide line. Today it is no longer fermented. Instead the salmon is "buried" in a dry marinade of salt, sugar, and dill, and cured for a few days. As the salmon cures, by the action of
osmosis
, the moisture turns the dry cure into a highly concentrated
brine
, which can be used as part of a sauce.
[8]
Gohu Ikan
Maluku, Indonesia
Gohu Ikan could be made with
tuna
,
skipjack
, or
grouper
. The fish is cut into small pieces. To remove the fishy smell, the fish meat is washed repeatedly until there's no more blood left. After cleaning thoroughly, the fish meat is marinated with salt and citrus juice. The red fish meat will become a bit white. It is then mixed and stirred with sliced onion, rica (a spicy chili), and basil leaves.It has a sour flavor, spicy, with a strong aroma of basil. Roasted and coarsely grounded canary seeds can be used as a flavor enhancer.

In modern times, the dishes are more often referred to as "raw fish slices". Commonly used fish in ancient times include
carp
and
mandarin fish
, but
salmon
is also used in modern times. Sauces were an essential part of kuai dishes, with
green onions

Some hors d'oeuvre: Mozzarella cheese sprinkled with
basil
flowers, black Greek olives, sun-dried tomatoes, Italian salami and Spanish Lomo Ibérico.
This is a list of notable
hors d'oeuvre
, also referred to as appetizers, which may be served either hot or cold. They are food items served before the main courses of a meal, and are also sometimes served at the dinner table as a part of a meal. Many cultures serve
dips
, such as
baba ghanoush
,
chili con queso
,
hummus
, and
tzatziki
with
bread
or
vegetables
as hors d'oeuvre.
If the period between when guests arrive and when the meal is eaten (for example during a
cocktail
hour) is extended these might also serve the purpose of sustaining guests during the wait, in the same way that
apéritifs
are served as a drink before meals. Hors d'oeuvre are sometimes served with no meal afterward; this is the case with many
reception
and
cocktail party
events.

This is a
list of chocolate bar brands
, in alphabetical order. A
chocolate bar
is a confection in bar form comprising some or all of the following components:
cocoa solids
,
cocoa butter
,
sugar
, and/or
milk
. The relative presence or absence of these components form the subclasses of
dark chocolate
,
milk chocolate
, and
white chocolate
. In addition to these main ingredients, it may contain
emulsifiers
such as
soy lecithin
and flavours such as
vanilla
.
In most of the English-speaking world, chocolate bar also refers to what is sometimes called a
candy bar
in American English. This is a form of
confectionery
usually packaged in a bar or log form, often coated with
chocolate
, and sized as a
snack
for one person. Within that term, a variety of products exists, ranging from solid chocolate bars to multiple layerings or mixtures of ingredients such as
nuts
,
fruit
,
caramel
, or
fondant
containing no chocolate.

This is a
list of
companies
which produce
chocolate
, not chocolates. That is, they process
cocoa beans
into a product in-house, rather than merely melting chocolate from another manufacturer.
Some are large companies that own the entire process for economic reasons; others aim to control the whole process to improve quality, working conditions, or environmental impact.

Dipping sauce
Type
Condiment
Cookbook: Dip
Media: Dip
A
dip
or
dipping sauce
is a common
condiment
for many types of food. Dips are used to add flavor or texture to a food, such as
pita bread
,
dumplings
,
crackers
, cut-up raw
vegetables
,
fruits
,
seafood
, cubed pieces of
meat
and
cheese
,
potato chips
,
tortilla chips
, and
falafel
. Unlike other
sauces
, instead of applying the sauce to the food, the food is typically put, dipped, or added into the dipping sauce (hence the name).
Dips are commonly used for
finger foods
,
appetizers
, and other easily held foods. Thick dips based on
sour cream
,
crème fraîche
,
milk
,
yogurt
,
mayonnaise
,
soft cheese
, or
beans
are a staple of American hors d'oeuvres and are thinner than
spreads
which can be thinned to make dips.
[1]
Alton Brown
suggests that a dip is defined based on its ability to "maintain contact with its transport mechanism over three feet of white carpet".
[2]
Dips in various forms are eaten all over the world and people have been using sauces for dipping for thousands of years.

Food drying
is a method of
food preservation
that works by removing
water
from the food, which inhibits the growth of
bacteria
and has been practiced worldwide since ancient times to preserve food. Where or when dehydration as a food preservation technique was invented has been lost to time, but the earliest known practice of food drying is 12,000 BC by inhabitants of the modern Middle East and Asia.

common beans
Beans
is a common name for large plant
seeds
used for human food or animal feed of several
genera
of the
family
Fabaceae
(alternately
Leguminosae
). The term is sometimes used as a synonym of
pulse
, though the term pulses is usually reserved for leguminous crops harvested for their dry grain. Dried beans include
kidney beans
,
black turtle beans
,
pinto beans
, and several others.
Grain

,
oats
, etc. are dried in
grain dryers
.
[18]
In the main agricultural countries, drying comprises the reduction of moisture from about 17–30% to 8-15%, depending on the grain. The final moisture content for drying must be adequate for storage. Additional grains include
lentils
,
wild rice
,
chick peas
, and
millet
.
Some varieties of
maize
(usually called corn in North America) are dried to produce
popcorn
. Popcorn kernels with a high moisture content will pop when freshly harvested, but not well, and are also susceptible to mold when stored. So, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand (pop) the most when cooked. Dried maize left on the ear is also used for decorative purposes.

This is a list of fish considered halal according to the
Shia Muslims
in the
Jafari jurisprudence
as well as being
kosher
according to
Jews
as per the
kashrut
dietary laws in the
halakha
of rabbinic
Judaism
.
In the Jafari Muslim tradition, these fish are halal because they possess the appropriate characteristic of having true
fish scales
.
[1]
[2]
In Judaism, in addition to requiring the presence of true fish scales, kosher fish must also have
fins
. This seemingly redundant requirement serves to remove ambiguity by excluding finless sea creatures that possess various features which might be confused for scales, including shells (such as those of shrimp or prawns). While not every fish that has fins will have scales, every true fish that has true fish scales by default also has fins.
[3]
As per the modern scientific definition, in Judaism also, the shells of crustaceans are their
exoskeleton
("outer skeleton"), and they are thus not kosher for not only lacking fins but also for lacking true scales.
In some Islamic schools of thought where scales are also a trait required of halal fish, including the Jafari Shia, exoskeletons are also not included as "scales". However, other Islamic schools of thought, both Sunni and Shia, have looser definitions which include the exoskeleton of crustaceans as "scales", others yet include the softer exoskeletons of prawns as "scales" but exclude the harder exoskeletons of lobsters.
While there is nothing specifically mentioned in Jewish halakha requiring kosher fish having an
endoskeleton
("inner skeleton") and
gills
(as opposed to lungs), every true fish that has both scales and fins by default also possesses an endoskeleton and gills. Any sea creature that lacks gills and can only breathe oxygen from air through lungs, or has an exoskeleton instead of and endoskeleton
[4]
:
343
, is by default not kosher because it cannot be a fish.
The list of fish on this page, therefore, coincides with those which possess the combination of endoskeleton, gills, fins, and scales.

Kosher
[
edit
]
According to the
chok
or divine decrees of the
Torah
and the
Talmud
, for a fish to be declared kosher, it must have scales and fins.
[5]
The definition of "scale" differs from the definitions presented in biology, in that the scales of a kosher fish must be visible to the eye, present in the adult form, and can be easily removed from the skin either by hand or scaling knife.
[5]
Thus, a grass carp, mirror carp, and salmon are kosher, whereas a shark, whose scales are microscopic, a sturgeon, whose scutes can not be easily removed without cutting them out of the body, and a swordfish, which loses all of its scales as an adult, are all not kosher.
[5]
When a (kosher) fish is removed from the water, it is considered "slaughtered," and it is unnecessary to ritually kill it in the manner of kosher livestock. However, kosher law explicitly forbids the consumption of a fish while it is still alive.
[5]
Talmudic law proscribes against cooking fish together with meat, or fish with actual milk (or in certain communities fish with any dairy) for health reasons, though fish may be eaten together with meat in a meal if they are in separate dishes or courses. The same applies to consuming fish and actual milk, or fish and other dairy products, within the same meal in the respective communities who prohibit cooking them together.

Shia
[

Shia Islam
's regulation of fish in the
Jaafari
school of jurisprudence comes from several
sahih
hadiths
, one of them is, as narrated by the fifth
imam
Muhammad al-Baqir
:
Eat any fish that has scales, and do not eat what does not have scales.
—
Al-Kulayni
,
Al-Kafi
, Vol.6, p. 219
Sunni
[
edit
]
In
Sunni Islam
, there are two general schools of thought. Most Sunni Muslim schools of jurisprudence (
Shafi'i
,
Hanbali
, and
Maliki
) hold as a general rule that all "sea game" (animals of the sea) are permissible to eat with a few minor exceptions.
Thus, for example, the traditional
Laksa
soup of Shafi'i Sunni Muslim majority
Malaysia
(which includes meats such as shrimp and squid with a soup base made from
shrimp paste
) is permisssble.
The combined total population of Muslims in all these Sunni Muslim schools of jurisprudence, however, are a minority among the worldwide population of Sunni Muslims.
Hanafi
[
edit
]
In the
Hanafi
school of Sunni Muslim jurisprudence, to which the majority population of Sunni Muslims belong to, only "fish" (as opposed to all "sea game") are permissible, but not
eels
and
hagfish
(even though both eels and hagfish are also biologically fish).
Any other sea (or water) creatures which are not fish, therefore, are also haram (forbidden), whether they breathe oxygen from
water
through
gills
(such as prawns, shrimp, lobsters and crabs which are
crustaceans
) and especially if they breathe oxygen from
air
through
lungs
(such as sea turtles and sea snakes which are
reptiles
, dolphins and whales which are
mammals
, or semi-aquatic animals like penguins which are
birds
,
saltwater crocodiles
which are reptiles, seals which are mammals, and frogs which are
amphibians
).
[7]
For Hanafi Sunni Muslims, therefore, laksa soup would be haram (prohibited).

Pasta
is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, which comes in many forms. Typically, pasta is a noodle made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. However, it is often disputed whether or not pasta classifies as a noodle in common speech, or if there is a distinction.

The brazen assemblage of hot pastrami, grilled knockwurst, melted Swiss and hot mustard on rye bread, curiously known in these parts as a "sailor sandwich" is, most likely, a true Richmond native. Carytown’s New York Deli, established in 1929 and operating at its current location since 1934, bills itself as 'the birthplace of the sailor sandwich.'

In some countries, such as the United States, the phrase "ice cream" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients.

whiskey
drink that has been described as a "sturdy, healthful
eggnog
type of drink, with eggs, whiskey, etc., served as a tonic as well as a treat".

Chicken soup
A bowl of
Okroshka
soup
This is a
list of notable soups
.
Soups
have been made since
ancient times
.
Some soups are served with large chunks of meat or vegetables left in the liquid, while a
broth
is a flavored liquid usually derived from boiling a type of meat with bone, a spice mix, or a vegetable mix for a period of time in a
stock
. A common type of broth is
consommé
, which are crystal clear broths or stock that have a full flavor, aroma, and body.
A
potage
is a category of thick soups,
stews
, or
porridges
, in some of which meat and vegetables are boiled together with water until they form into a thick mush.
Bisques
are
heavy cream
soups traditionally prepared with
shellfish
, but can be made with any type of
seafood
or other base ingredients. Cream soups are a dairy based soup. Although they may be consumed on their own, or with a meal, the canned, condensed form of cream soup is sometimes used as a quick
sauce
in a variety of
meat
and
pasta
convenience food
dishes, such as
casseroles
. Similar to a bisque,
chowders
are thick soups usually containing some type of starch.
Coulis
were originally meat juices, and now are thick
purées
.
Some soups are served only cold, and other soups can optionally be served cold.

Important progress has been made in the past decade concerning research findings on kombucha tea and reports claiming that drinking kombucha can prevent various types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, promote liver functions, and stimulate the immune system.

oxygen radical absorbance capacity
Regulatory guidance
[
edit
]
In the following discussion, the term "antioxidant" refers mainly to non-nutrient compounds in foods, such as polyphenols, which have
antioxidant capacity
in vitro
and so provide an artificial index of antioxidant strength – the ORAC measurement. Other than for dietary antioxidant vitamins –
vitamin A
,
vitamin C
and
vitamin E
– no food compounds have been proved with antioxidant efficacy
in vivo
. Accordingly, regulatory agencies like the
Food and Drug Administration
of the United States and the
European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) have published guidance disallowing food product labels to claim an inferred antioxidant benefit when no such physiological evidence exists.
[1]
[2]
Polyphenols in foods
[
edit
]
Many common foods contain rich sources of
polyphenols
which have antioxidant properties only in test tube studies. As interpreted by the
Linus Pauling Institute
, dietary polyphenols have little or no direct antioxidant food value following digestion.
[3]
Not like controlled test tube conditions, the fate of flavones or polyphenols
in vivo
shows they are poorly absorbed and poorly conserved (less than 5%), so that most of what is absorbed exists as metabolites modified during digestion, destined for rapid excretion.
[4]
Spices, herbs, and
essential oils
are rich in polyphenols in the plant itself and shown with antioxidant potential
in vitro
. Typical spices high in polyphenols (confirmed in vitro) are
clove
,
cinnamon
,
oregano
,
turmeric
,
cumin
,
parsley
,
basil
,
curry powder
,
mustard seed
,
ginger
,
pepper
,
chili powder
,
paprika
,
garlic
,
coriander
,
onion
and
cardamom
. Typical herbs are
sage
,
thyme
,
marjoram
,
tarragon
,
peppermint
,
oregano
,
savory
,
basil
and
dill weed
.
Dried fruits are a good source of polyphenols by weight/serving size as the water has been removed making the ratio of polyphenols higher. Typical dried fruits are pears, apples, plums, peaches, raisins, figs and dates. Dried raisins are high in polyphenol count. Red wine is high in total polyphenol count which supplies antioxidant quality which is unlikely to be conserved following digestion (see section below).
Deeply pigmented fruits like cranberries, blueberries, plums, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrants, figs, cherries, guava, oranges, mango, grape juice and pomegranate juice also have significant polyphenol content.
Typical cooked vegetables rich in antioxidants are
artichokes
,
cabbage
,
broccoli
,
asparagus
,
avocados
,
beetroot
and
spinach
.
Nuts are a moderate source of polyphenol antioxidants. Typical nuts are
pecans
,
walnuts
,
hazelnuts
,
pistachio
,
almonds
,
cashew nuts
,
macadamia nuts
and
peanut butter
.
Sorghum bran,
cocoa
powder, and
cinnamon
are rich sources of procyanidins, which are large
molecular weight
compounds found in many fruits and some vegetables. Partly due to the large molecular weight (size) of these compounds, their amount actually absorbed in the body is low, an effect also resulting from the action of stomach acids, enzymes and bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract where smaller derivatives are metabolized and prepared for rapid excretion.
[3]
[4]
Physiological context
[
edit
]
Despite the above discussion implying that ORAC-rich foods with polyphenols may provide antioxidant benefits when in the diet, there remains no physiological evidence that any polyphenols have such actions or that ORAC has any relevance in the human body.
On the contrary, research indicates that although polyphenols are good
antioxidants
in vitro
, antioxidant effects
in vivo
are probably negligible or absent.
[5]
[6]
[7]
By non-antioxidant mechanisms still undefined, polyphenols may affect mechanisms of cardiovascular disease or cancer.
[8]
The increase in antioxidant capacity of blood seen after the consumption of polyphenol-rich (ORAC-rich) foods is not caused directly by the polyphenols, but most likely results from increased
uric acid
levels derived from metabolism of flavonoids.
[3]
[4]
According to Frei, "we can now follow the activity of flavonoids in the body, and one thing that is clear is that the body sees them as foreign compounds and is trying to get rid of them."
[4]
Another mechanism may be the increase in activities of paraoxonases by dietary antioxidants which can reduce oxidative stress.
[9]
Vitamins
[
edit
]
Vitamin A
(retinol), also
synthesized
by the body from
beta-carotene
, protects dark green, yellow and orange vegetables and fruits from
solar radiation
damage, and is thought to play a similar role in the human body.
Carrots
,
squash
,
broccoli
,
sweet potatoes
,
tomatoes
(which gain their color from the compound
lycopene
),
kale
,
mangoes
,
oranges
,
seabuckthorn
berries,
wolfberries
(goji),
collards
,
cantaloupe
,
peaches
and
apricots
are particularly rich sources of
beta-carotene
, the major
provitamin A
carotenoid
.
Vitamin C
(ascorbic acid) is a water-
soluble
compound that fulfills several roles in living systems. Important sources include
citrus
fruits (such as
oranges
,
sweet lime
, etc.),
green peppers
,
broccoli
,
green leafy vegetables
,
black currants
,
strawberries
,
blueberries
,
seabuckthorn
, raw
cabbage
and
tomatoes
.
Vitamin E
, including
tocotrienol
and
tocopherol
, is fat soluble and protects
lipids
. Sources include
wheat germ
,
seabuckthorn
,
nuts
,
seeds
,
whole grains
,
green leafy vegetables
,
kiwifruit
,
vegetable oil
, and
fish-liver oil
. Alpha-tocopherol is the main form in which vitamin E is consumed. Recent studies showed that some tocotrienol isomers have significant anti-oxidant properties.

glucuronidation
. However, bioavailability is substantially enhanced by solubilization in a lipid (oil or lecithin),
[10]
heat,
[11]
addition of
piperine
,
[10]
or through nanoparticularization.

Xanthones
-
mangosteen
is purported to contain a large variety of xanthones,

but some of the xanthones like
mangostin
might be present only in the
inedible shell

Alcoholic drink
– An
alcoholic drink
is a drink containing
ethanol
, commonly known as alcohol, although in
chemistry
the definition of an
alcohol
includes many other compounds. Alcoholic drinks, such as
wine
,
beer
, and
liquor
have been part of human culture and development for 8,000 years. Many
brands
of alcoholic drinks are produced worldwide.

Beer
[

Bottled beer
Beer
–
beer
is produced by the
saccharification
of
starch
and
fermentation
of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification
enzymes
are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly
malted
barley and malted wheat.
[3]
Most beer is also flavoured with
hops
, which
add bitterness
and act as a natural
preservative
, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called
brewing
.

Cider
Cider
–
cider
is a
fermented
alcoholic drink
made from
apple juice
. Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2%
ABV
to 8.5% or more in traditional English ciders. In some regions, cider may be called "apple wine".

Distilled drinks
– also known as liquor and spirits, a
distilled drink
is an alcoholic drink produced by
distillation
of a mixture produced from
alcoholic fermentation
, such as wine. This process purifies it and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its
proportion
of alcohol content (commonly known as alcohol by volume,
ABV
).
[5]
As distilled drinks contain more alcohol they are considered "harder" - in North America, the term hard liquor is used to distinguish distilled drinks from undistilled ones, which are implicitly weaker.

Cocktails
– a
cocktail
refers to any kind of
alcoholic
mixed drink
that contains two or more ingredients. As generally understood today, a cocktail requires at least one alcoholic component—typically a
distilled spirit
, although
beer
and
wine
are permissible—and one sweet component; it may also contain a souring or bittering ingredient.

Wine
[

]

Wine
–
wine
is an alcoholic drink made from
fermented
grapes
or other fruits. The natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of
sugars
,
acids
,
enzymes
, water, or other
nutrients
.
[7]
Yeast consumes the sugars
in the grapes and converts them into
alcohol
and
carbon dioxide
. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation,
terroir
and subsequent
appellation
, along with human intervention in the overall process.

, is a major
cereal grain
. It was one of the first cultivated grains and is now grown widely. Barley is used in various drinks and as a source of fermentable material for
beer
and certain
distilled drinks
. In a 2007 ranking of cereal crops in the world, barley was fourth both in terms of quantity produced (136 million tons) and in area of cultivation (566,000 square kilometres or 219,000 square miles).

food
produced from the seed of the tropical
Theobroma cacao
tree. Its earliest documented use is by the
Olmecs
of south central Mexico around 1100 BC. The majority of
Mesoamerican
people made chocolate drinks, including the
Mayans
and
Aztecs
,
[9]
who made it into a drink known as
xocolātl
[ʃoˈkolaːt͡ɬ]
, a
Nahuatl
word meaning "bitter water".

Provisionally, this is primarily southern
Coast Salish
, though much is in common with Coast Salish overall.
Anthropogenic
grasslands
were maintained. The south Coast Salish may have had more vegetables and land game than people farther north or on the outer coast.
Salmon
and other
fish
were staples in this area. There was
kokanee
, a freshwater fish in the
Lake Washington
and
Lake Sammamish
watersheds.
Shellfish
were abundant.
Butter clams
,
horse clams
, and
cockles
were dried for trade.
Hunting was specialized; professions were probably sea hunters, land hunters, and fowlers. Water fowl were captured on moonless nights using strategic flares.
The managed
grasslands
not only provided game habitat, but vegetable sprouts, roots, bulbs, berries, and nuts were foraged from them as well as found wild. The most important were probably
bracken
and
camas
, and
wapato
especially for the
Duwamish
. Many, many varieties of berries were foraged; some were harvested with comblike devices not reportedly used elsewhere.
Acorns
were relished but were not widely available. Regional tribes went in autumn to the
Nisqually
Flats (Nisqually plains) to harvest them.
[6]
Indeed, the region was so abundant that the southern
Puget Sound
as a whole had one of the only
sedentary hunter-gatherer societies
that has ever existed.

Neolithic founder crops
[
edit

The Neolithic founder crops (or primary domesticates) are the eight plant
species
that were
domesticated
by early
Holocene
(
Pre-Pottery Neolithic A
and
Pre-Pottery Neolithic B
) farming communities in the
Fertile Crescent
region of
southwest Asia
, and which formed the basis of systematic
agriculture
in the Middle East, North Africa, India,
Persia
and (later) Europe. They consist of
flax
, three
cereals
and four
pulses
, and are the first known domesticated plants in the world. Although domesticated
rye
(
Secale cereale
) occurs in the final Epi-Palaeolithic strata at
Tell Abu Hureyra
(the earliest instance of a domesticated plant species), it was insignificant in the Neolithic Period of southwest Asia and only became common with the spread of farming into
northern Europe
several millennia later.

There was a great deal of commerce between the provinces of the
Roman Empire
. All the regions of the empire became interdependent with one another; some provinces specialized in the production of grain, others in
wine
and others in
olive oil
, depending on the soil type. Columella writes in his
Res Rustica
, "Soil that is heavy, chalky, and wet is not unsuited to the growing for
winter wheat
and
spelt
.
Barley
tolerates no place except one that is loose and dry."
[7]
Pliny the Elder
writes extensively about agriculture from books XII to XIX; in fact, XVIII is
The Natural History of Grain

The first instances of domestication of plants for agricultural purposes in Africa occurred in the
Sahel
region circa 5000 BCE, when
sorghum
and
African Rice
(
Oryza glaberrima
) began to be cultivated. Around this time, and in the same region,
Fonio
and the small
guineafowl
were domesticated.
Around 4000 BCE the climate of the Sahara and the Sahel started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace. This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing
desertification
. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more humid climate of West Africa.
[11]
The most famous crop domesticated in the
Ethiopian highlands
is
coffee
.
Khat
,
ensete
,
noog
,
teff
and
finger millet
were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include
sorghum
and
pearl millet
. The
kola nut
, extracts from which became an ingredient in
Coca-Cola
, was first domesticated in West Africa. Other crops domesticated in West Africa include
African rice
,
African yams
,
black-eyed peas
and the
oil palm
.

Fruits of Australian origin

Although the fruits of Australia were eaten for thousands of years as
bushfood
by
Aboriginal
people, they have only been recently recognized for their culinary qualities by non-indigenous people. Many are regarded for their piquancy and spice-like qualities for use in cooking and
preserves
. Some Australian fruits also have exceptional nutritional qualities, including high
vitamin C
and other
antioxidants

Current importance of food origins
[
edit
]
In 2016, researchers linked the origins and primary regions of diversity ("areas typically including the locations of the initial domestication of crops, encompassing the primary geographical zones of crop variation generated since that time, and containing relatively high species richness in crop wild relatives") of food and agricultural crops with their current importance around the world in modern national food supplies and agricultural production. The results indicated that national diets and farm production around the world were generally composed of a large set of crops from many diverse origins. Foreign crops (crops whose origins do not include the same region as the country) comprised 68.7% of national food supplies as a global mean, and their usage has increased in the last fifty years.

Cranberries are as American as apple pie - in fact, even more so, for cranberries are one of only three major native North American fruits (
Concord grapes
and blueberries being the others). Long before the Pilgrims arrived in 1620
CE
, the North American Indians combined crushed cranberries with dried deer meat and melted fat to make
pemmican
, a food that would keep for a long time.

List of foods with religious symbolism
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The
list of foods with religious symbolism
provides details, and links to articles, of foods which are used in religious communities or traditions to symbolise an aspect of the faith, or to commemorate a festival or hero of that faith group. Many such foods are also closely associated with a particular date or season. As with all religious traditions, some such foods have passed into widespread secular use, but all those on this list have a religious origin. The list is arranged alphabetically and by religion.
Many religions have a particular 'cuisine' or tradition of cookery, associated with their culture (see, for example,
List of Jewish cuisine dishes
). This list is
not
intended for foods which are merely part of the cultural heritage of a religious body, but
specifically
those foods that bear religious symbolism in the way they are made, or the way they are eaten, or both.

Easter eggs are used as a Christian symbol to represent the empty tomb. The outside of the egg looks dead but inside there is new life, which is going to break out. The Easter egg is a reminder that Jesus will rise from His tomb and bring new life. Orthodox Christians dye boiled eggs red to make
red Easter eggs
that represent the blood of Christ shed for the sins of the world.

Just so, on that first Easter morning, Jesus came to life and walked out of the tomb, and left it, as it were, an empty shell. Just so, too, when the Christian dies, the body is left in the grave, an empty shell, but the soul takes wings and flies away to be with God. Thus you see that though an egg seems to be as dead as a stone, yet it really has life in it; and also it is like Christ's dead body, which was raised to life again. This is the reason we use eggs on Easter. (In days past some used to color the eggs red, so as to show the kind of death by which Christ died,-a
bloody
death.)

To mark the end of the Lent fast Christians eat hot cross buns. These have a special meaning. The cross in the middle shows how Jesus died. Spices inside remind Christians of the spices put on the body of Jesus. Sweet fruits in the bun show that Christians no longer have to eat plain foods.

Since people often gave up meat during Lent, bread became one of the staples of Lent. Bakers even began making dough pretzels--a knotted length of dough that represented a Christian praying, with arms crossed and hands placed on opposite shoulders.

on a street and in other public places, such as at a market or fair. It is often sold from a portable
food booth
