Papedas are a group of less palatable, slow-growing, hardy citrus native to
Asia
, formerly placed in the subgenus

of the genus
Citrus
. The papeda group includes some of the most tropical, and also some of the most frost-tolerant citrus plants. They are cultivated far less often than other citrus, though they will all hybridize with other citrus.
This group contains about 15 species.

The leaves of the plant reach out towards the sun and for this reason the plant is sometimes called the Compass Plant. Prickly Lettuce can grow to be from two to five feet tall but should be harvested early on when it is a few inches high. The young leaves of the plant are very tender and make an excellent salad green. As a potherb, the plant needs little cooking and is commonly made with a sauce of melted butter or vinegar. Prickly lettuce should be harvested in spring or early summer.

Glasswort
Glasswort is a leafless plant with jointed stems that are a light green color in the summer and a red color in the fall. There are very small flowers within the segmented portions of the plant. The plant is found in coastal salt marshes and alkaline soils within south Nova Scotia and Eastern and central North America. The stems have a salty flavor and can be harvested to be used in salads, as a puree, or as a pickled condiment.

List of cheeses

Plain

Omelette
Plain
France

dish

meat
(often
ham

Sometimes an Omelette will be placed under a grill to cook the top as it may not be possible to flip and the bottom may burn before the top is cooked through.
Flat Egg
Plain
UK
Similar to an

, with a single beaten egg, but salt/pepper is added to the egg prior to cooking, and cooked in a dry pan, or with minimal oil. When one side is complete it is flipped to the other side. The egg is usually cooked until brown on both sides and then served on bread.
A flat egg is always served on bread as a sandwich style and never served on a plate with other items, as an Omelette can be.
'Flat Egg' is a colloquial term, and differs from an omelette as it never contains any other items, and is used where a person doesn't like the white or yolk of an egg, so when beaten they can enjoy a cooked egg.

[5]

Ackee and saltfish
Jamaica
Salt cod
sautéed with boiled
ackee
, onions,
Scotch Bonnet
peppers
(optional)
, tomatoes, and spices, such as black pepper and
pimiento
. It can be garnished with crisp bacon and fresh tomatoes, and is usually served as breakfast or dinner alongside
breadfruit
,
hard dough bread
,
dumplings
, fried plantain, or bogreen
bananas
. Jamaica's
national dish
.
Bacalaíto
Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic
Salt cod
fritters
filled with minced cod fish and garnished with cilantro, tomatoes and onions. A traditional snack typically eaten with an entire meal. Bacalaítos are served at the beach,
cuchifritos
, and at festivals. They are crisp on the outside and dense and chewy in the inside.
Scotland and
Orkney
Made with
speldings
, young fish of the
Gadidae
family such as cod, haddock or
whiting
. The name is a derivative of
cabillaud
, the
French
name for cod. Other ingredients include
parsley
,
horseradish
and
mashed potato
. The sauce is made with butter, flour, milk, hard-boiled eggs, and
nutmeg
. Alternate versions outside the traditional version's only difference are usually an addition of more spices.
Codfish Brás Style
Portugal
Made with eggs, onions thinly sliced, potatoes in matchstick-size, salt codfish, soaked, minced garlic clove, extra virgin olive oil, bunch fresh parsley, chopped black Portuguese olives, salt and pepper.
[7]
Crappit heid
Scotland
(English: stuffed head).
Can be traced to the fishing communities of the North, Hebrides and North-Eastern Scotland in the eighteenth century. In a time when money was scarce, the more expensive
fillets
of fish, such as
cod
or
haddock
would be sold to market but the
offal
and less attractive parts were retained by the fisherfolk for the pot.
Cullen skink
Scotland
Thick soup made of smoked haddock, potatoes and onions. An authentic cullen skink will use
finnan haddie
, but it may be prepared with any other undyed smoked haddock. The soup is often served as a starter at formal Scottish dinners. It has been described as "smokier and more assertive than American
chowder
and heartier than classical French
bisque
".
[8]
Fish and brewis
Newfoundland
Consists of cod and
hard bread
or
hard tack
. With the abundance of cod around the coasts of
Newfoundland and Labrador
it became synonymous with many Newfoundland households as a delicacy to be served as a main meal.
salt fish
is soaked in water overnight to reduce the salt content. The hard bread is broken into bite-size pieces, and is also soaked in water overnight. The next day, the fish and hard bread are boiled separately until tender, and then both are served together. The traditional meal is served with
scrunchions
,
[9]
salted pork fat which has been cut into small pieces and fried. Both the rendered fat and the liquid fat are then drizzled over the fish and hard bread.
Fish ball
Widespread
Usually made from a white fish, such as
cod
or
haddock
Fishcake
British
Similar to a
croquette
, consisting of a
filleted fish
and potato patty sometimes coated in
breadcrumbs
or
batter
, and fried. Salted cod is traditionally used as a filling, though since cod stocks have become depleted other varieties of
white fish
are used, such as
haddock
or
whiting
.
[10]
The fishcake has been seen as a way of using up
leftovers
that might otherwise be thrown away. In
Mrs Beeton
's 19th century publication
Book of Household Management
, her recipe for fishcakes calls for "leftover fish" and "cold
potatoes
".

Bloater
England
Popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries, bloaters are now rare. They can be contrasted with
kippers
. Kippers are salted and cold smoked overnight while bloaters are salted less and not smoked for so long. Kippers are split and gutted before smoking while bloaters are smoked whole without gutting. Kippers are associated with Scotland while bloaters are associated with England. Bloaters have their own characteristic slightly gamey flavor and are called "bloaters" because they swell or bloat during preparation.

salmon

osmosis

brine
, which can be used as part of a sauce.
