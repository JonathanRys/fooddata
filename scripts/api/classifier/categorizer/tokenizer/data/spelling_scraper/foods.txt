It is often served accompanied by a side salad, potatoes (fries or boiled potatoes), and, typically, tartar sauce. The dish may also be prepared with a thin slice of ham inserted between two slices of cheese, and in Czech fast food outlets it is often served in the form of a sandwich – in something similar to a hamburger bun.

This is due to the specific composition of flora that free-ranging cows feed upon on the upland pastures, as well as to the microclimatic conditions of the locality. The attempts to make this cheese elsewhere following the same recipe have failed. The producers from this region are proud of their cheese, and for years have been trying to initialize the procedure for the protection of geographic origin.

Travnički (Vlašić) cheese
This cheese is very valued as a delicacy in whole of Montenegro, and it is one of the most expensive fresh cheeses on the national market. The name of this cheese is derived from its specific texture. Thin, sometimes almost transparent, layers create a leafy structure, and make strings when the cheese is pulled apart. It has a pleasant mild fragrance. It does not contain high levels of fat, so its taste is mild and light.All producers make it in a similar manner, although every family has their own small secret that distinguishes their cheese, of which they are rather protective. What is known is that this cheese is made by combining the skimmed and whole cow milk. After adding the rennet, which makes milk curd, the cheese is drained and then frequently turned and folded. It is this manipulation that creates thin layers – leafs – that give it a characteristic texture.
Bread that is flat in shape, often round in shape.

A traditional (at least from the Ming dynasty) food that is made from glutinous rice paste that has been rolled into small balls, boiled, then put into a soup base. These are traditionally white in color like the moon and eaten during the first full moon after Chinese New Year and symbolize togetherness of family. They are also often pink, or a mixture of pink and white balls, because red signifies good luck in Chinese culture (but red dye added to the white results in pink). Sometimes savory or sweet stuffings (such as red bean paste) are added.

, a semi-soft cow's milk cheese made like most cheeses by introducing rennet to milk to cause curdling. The curds are pressed into cheese molds which are drained, and then the cheese is aged. It is a washed curd cheese, which contributes to the subtle flavor. It is interior-ripened, rindless, smooth and slightly bright-surfaced. It has very small and irregular openings ("eyes") distributed in the mass. Havarti has a buttery aroma and can be somewhat sharp in the stronger varieties, much like Swiss cheese. The taste is buttery, and from somewhat sweet to very sweet, and it is slightly acidic.

Prickly lettuce is a common edible weed that is native to Europe, but can now be found from coast to coast in the United States. The name comes from the small prickles that can be found on the lower part of the stem and the midrib of the leaves. The plant is found in fields, places of waste, and roadsides. The leaves of the plant reach out towards the sun and for this reason the plant is sometimes called the Compass Plant. Prickly Lettuce can grow to be from two to five feet tall but should be harvested early on when it is a few inches high. The young leaves of the plant are very tender and make an excellent salad green. As a potherb, the plant needs little cooking and is commonly made with a sauce of melted butter or vinegar. Prickly lettuce should be harvested in spring or early summer.

Black mustard is commonly found in neglected gardens, on roadsides, in abandoned fields, and in areas where waste is disposed of. The plant is native to Asia and Europe, but now grows over much of southern Canada and almost all of the United States. This is the chief mustard used in condiments and as such is normally associated with hot-dogs. To make the mustard condiment, the seeds must be ground fine and then mixed with flour and a small portion of water and vinegar. The plant can be cultivated for its young leaves which are used in a salad or as a pot herb.
